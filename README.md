## Overview
second challenge on the Frontend Mentor plattform sees me trying to create a blog preview card.

## My process
I tried to sketch what the webpage would look like.
then i tried writing down raw HTML but then realized it would be time consuming. 
-I was anxious to get started with the coding so i had to stop the pqper drafts and pick up my laptop.
-I actually coded the entire project before heading to github to host it.
-I never really created a Git repository from the begining. only at the end.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
-Bootstrap



### What I learned

I learned about media queries
-transform property for container elements.
-trying to size elements based on overall size of the main parent to which they all belong.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<article>Some HTML code I'm i learned of</article>
```

### Continued development
i want to continue learning how to size elements into a container and also how to propely use flexbox and grids to organize different elements on a single page.
i want to learn how to properly scale up and down a container based on screen different device sizes.

### Useful resources

- [Example: AI](https://www.chatGPT.com) - This helped me for so many explanations especially when certain styles werent working as expected.
- [Example YouTube](https://www.YouTube.com) - sometimes i just had to head over to youTube and watch tons of videos for clarifications.
